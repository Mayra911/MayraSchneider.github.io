# Customer Churn Prediction

Customer churn is a critical issue in the telecommunications industry, impacting profitability and customer retention. This project uses machine learning to predict churn, enabling businesses to take proactive measures and improve customer satisfaction.

---

## Key Outcomes
- Achieved **81.7% accuracy** using Logistic Regression, with a weighted F1 score of **0.81**.
- Random Forest model was tested but achieved a slightly lower accuracy of **80%**.
- **Top predictor of churn:** *Month-to-Month contract type*, emphasizing the importance of subscription models in churn behavior.

---

## Project Highlights
- **Data Analysis:** Conducted in-depth analysis of customer demographics, service details, and account information to identify trends and correlations.
- **Machine Learning Models:** 
  - Logistic Regression achieved a balanced performance with high precision and recall.
  - Random Forest model tested as a benchmark for comparison.
- **Deployment:** Designed a user-friendly Flask application to allow users to upload datasets and get predictions in real-time.
